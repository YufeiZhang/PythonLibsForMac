Install Python, NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib on Mac OS X (highest version 10.11.2)

Make sure you get the most recent version that is explicitly for Mac OS 10.6-10.7+.

Install Python
Go to the Python download page and download the package called Python 2.7.2 Mac OS X 64-bit/32-bit x86-64/i386 Installer. Double-click the downloaded .dmg file to install Python.

Install NumPy
Go to the NumPy download page and download the package called numpy-1.6.1-py2.7-python.org-macosx10.6.dmg. Install as usual.

Install SciPy
Go to the SciPy download page and download the package called scipy-0.10.1-py2.7-python.org-macosx10.6.dmg. Install as usual.

Install matplotlib
Go to the matplotlib download page and download the package called matplotlib-1.2.0-py2.7-python.org-macosx10.6.dmg. Install as usual.

Congratulations, that should do it! If you ever want to upgrade one of these in the future revisit the appropriate download page and get the latest .dmg file. Fire up Python at a terminal and make sure things worked. The following should work in Python with no errors:

import numpy 
import scipy 
import matplotlib
